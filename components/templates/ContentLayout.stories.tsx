    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>
      This is a demo of the ContentLayout template. It's designed for standard
      content pages like About, Process, and Contact pages. The layout includes
      a hero section with a gradient background and a main content area with
      optional sidebar.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Responsive 2-column layout (content + sidebar)</li>
      <li>Prose-optimized typography for readability</li>
      <li>Sticky sidebar on desktop</li>
      <li>Gradient hero section</li>
      <li>Design system colors and spacing</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <p>
      The main content area uses prose styling, which provides optimal
      typography for long-form content. Headings use Fraunces font, and body
      text uses Inter font for readability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Links are styled with terracotta color and underline on hover, matching
      our design system. All spacing follows the 8-point grid system.
    </p>

        <h2>Discovery Phase</h2>
        <p>
          Every project starts with understanding the problem we're trying to
          solve. I work closely with stakeholders to define requirements,
          identify constraints, and establish success criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
          This phase typically includes user research, competitive analysis, and
          technical feasibility assessments. The goal is to ensure we're
          building the right thing before we start building anything.
        </p>

        <h2>Design Phase</h2>
        <p>
          With a clear understanding of the problem, I move into designing
          solutions. This includes wireframing, prototyping, and iterating based
          on feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          Design isn't just about aesthetics - it's about creating intuitive,
          accessible experiences that solve real user problems. I focus on
          design systems to ensure consistency and scalability.
        </p>

        <h2>Development Phase</h2>
        <p>
          Development is where designs come to life. I write clean, maintainable
          code following best practices and modern patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          This phase includes setting up development environments, implementing
          features, writing tests, and ensuring code quality through reviews and
          automated checks.
        </p>

        <h2>Testing Phase</h2>
        <p>
          Quality assurance is critical. I conduct thorough testing including
          unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to catch issues
          before they reach users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Testing also includes accessibility audits, performance optimization,
          and cross-browser compatibility checks.
        </p>

        <h2>Deployment Phase</h2>
        <p>
          Deployment is carefully planned and executed. I set up CI/CD pipelines
          for automated deployments, configure monitoring and logging, and
          ensure smooth rollouts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Post-deployment, I monitor performance, gather user feedback, and make
          iterative improvements based on real-world usage.
        </p>

        <h2>Maintenance Phase</h2>
        <p>
          Software is never truly "done". Ongoing maintenance includes bug
          fixes, security updates, performance optimization, and feature
          enhancements based on user needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe in continuous improvement and regular communication with
          stakeholders to ensure the product continues to meet evolving
          requirements.
