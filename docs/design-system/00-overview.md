# Design System Overview

This portfolio website serves as a living case study of world-class design system architecture, demonstrating expertise in creating scalable, accessible, and human-first interfaces from first principles.

## Core Principles

Our design system is built on four foundational pillars:

### 1. Accessible by Default
- WCAG 2.1 AA minimum compliance
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader optimized components
- Semantic HTML and ARIA patterns

### 2. Human-First
- Natural, purposeful animations
- Intuitive interaction patterns
- Warm, approachable aesthetics
- Designed for real people, not just specifications

### 3. Design for Scale
- Composable component architecture
- Systematic design tokens
- Consistent patterns across all interfaces
- Built to grow and adapt

### 4. Speed Without Sacrifice
- 60fps animations as standard
- Optimized bundle sizes
- Beautiful AND performant
- No compromise between aesthetics and speed

## Build Methodology

We follow a systematic, layered approach combining **Airbnb's 8-point grid system** with **Atomic Design principles**.

### Foundation Layers (Built First)
1. **Color System** - Primitives, semantic tokens, light/dark modes
2. **Typography System** - Type scale, font families, text styles
3. **Spacing System** - 8-point grid, spacing scale
4. **Layout System** - Grid, breakpoints, container widths
5. **Foundation Tokens** - Shadows, radii, transitions, z-index

### Component Layers (Built on Foundation)
6. **Atoms** - Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, labels)
7. **Molecules** - Simple component groups (form fields, cards)
8. **Organisms** - Complex, reusable sections (navigation, forms)

## The 8-Point Grid Philosophy

All spatial measurements in this system use multiples of 8px. This creates:
- Visual rhythm and consistency
- Easier design-to-development handoff
- Scalable spacing that works across screen sizes
- Reduced decision fatigue in implementation

Our spacing scale: `4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 40px, 48px, 56px, 64px...`

## How to Use This Documentation

Each system document follows a consistent structure:

- **Overview** - What this system controls
- **Philosophy** - Why we made these decisions
- **Specifications** - The exact values and tokens
- **Implementation** - How to use in code
- **Usage Guidelines** - Best practices and patterns

Start with the foundation layers in order, then move to components. Each layer builds on the previous, creating a cohesive, systematic approach to interface design.
