# Color System

> **Status: ✅ Complete**

## Overview

Our color system forms the visual foundation of the design system, balancing earthy warmth with modern sophistication. It consists of three primitive color scales (terracotta, neutral, sage) mapped to semantic tokens that adapt seamlessly between light and dark modes while maintaining WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

## Philosophy

Our palette balances **earthy warmth with modern sophistication and approachability**. It's optimized for both light and dark modes, with accessibility as a non-negotiable requirement.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Terracotta primary** evokes craftsmanship and authenticity—perfect for a design systems portfolio
- **Warm neutrals** create a comfortable, timeless foundation (not stark blacks/whites)
- **Sage accent** provides natural, calming contrast without competing with the primary
- **Mode-adaptive tokens** ensure optimal contrast in both light and dark environments

## Color Psychology & Strategic Rationale

### Why Terracotta?

Terracotta evokes craftsmanship, authenticity, and timeless quality. In a sea of blue tech portfolios (Dribbble analysis shows 68% of developer portfolios use blue or gray), it positions me as someone who builds thoughtfully and values substance over trends. The warmth makes technical content approachable without sacrificing credibility.

**Color Psychology:**
- Warm terracotta = handcrafted quality, earthiness, durability
- Signals attention to detail and artisan-level craftsmanship
- Creates emotional resonance while maintaining professionalism

### Why Sage?

Sage provides calm, natural energy that complements terracotta's boldness. It signals balance, growth, and sustainability - qualities important in long-term software projects. Used sparingly for success states and secondary actions to avoid competing with the primary brand color.

**Color Psychology:**
- Sage green = growth, harmony, renewal
- Natural without being overly organic
- Calming counterbalance to terracotta's energy

### Why Warm Neutrals?

Pure black (#000000) and pure white (#FFFFFF) can feel clinical or harsh. Warm neutrals with brown undertones create a comfortable, inviting foundation that feels human-first. The neutral-50 background (#FAF7F5) and neutral-900 text (#2E2D2A) provide excellent contrast while feeling warmer and more approachable than stark black on white.

**Design Principle:**
"Accessible doesn't mean sterile" - we can meet WCAG standards while creating an inviting, warm experience.

### Competitive Differentiation

- **Standard approach:** Blue (trust/tech) + Gray (neutral)
- **My approach:** Terracotta (craft) + Sage (balance) + Warm Neutrals (comfort)
- **Result:** Memorable, professional, aligned with craftsmanship values

## Implementation

### TypeScript Tokens

Colors are defined in `lib/design-tokens/colors.ts`:

```typescript
import { colors, lightMode, darkMode } from '@/lib/design-tokens/colors';

// Access primitive colors
const brandColor = colors.primitives.terracotta[600];

// Access semantic tokens
const primaryLight = colors.lightMode.primary;
const primaryDark = colors.darkMode.primary;
```

### CSS Variables

CSS variables are defined in `app/globals.css` using the `:root` and `.dark` selectors:

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #B85032;
  --color-background: #FAF7F5;
  /* ... other light mode tokens */
}

.dark {
  --color-primary: #F4C5B3;
  --color-background: #1F1F1F;
  /* ... other dark mode tokens */
}
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Terracotta Usage Rules

✅ **DO:**
- Use `terracotta-500` for large headings (24px+) and decorative elements in light mode
- Use `terracotta-600` for primary buttons in light mode
- Use `terracotta-700` for text links in light mode
- Use `terracotta-200` for primary buttons in dark mode
- Use `terracotta-300` for text links in dark mode

❌ **DON'T:**
- Never use `terracotta-500` for normal-sized text or critical UI elements
- Never use `terracotta-600` or darker in dark mode (insufficient contrast)
- Never use terracotta on terracotta backgrounds

### Neutral Usage Rules

✅ **DO:**
- Use `neutral-50` as primary background (not pure white) for warmth
- Use pure white for elevated surfaces (cards, modals) in light mode
- Use `neutral-900` for primary text in light mode (not pure black)
- Maintain warm undertones throughout the neutral scale

❌ **DON'T:**
- Avoid stark black (#000000) and pure white (#FFFFFF) for primary backgrounds
- Don't mix cool grays with our warm neutrals

### Sage Usage Rules

✅ **DO:**
- Use for success states, confirmations, and positive feedback
- Use for secondary actions that complement primary terracotta
- Use for natural/eco-related messaging

❌ **DON'T:**
- Don't use sage as a competing primary color
- Avoid sage on sage backgrounds

```

## Design Decisions & Process

### 1. Decorative vs Functional Color Separation

**Decision:** Establish clear rules for when to use each terracotta shade.

**Rationale:**
- `terracotta-500` (~3.2:1 on neutral-50): Reserved for large headings (24px+) and decorative elements where WCAG allows lower contrast for large text
- `terracotta-600` (~4.65:1 on neutral-50): Functional UI - buttons, chips, badges
- `terracotta-700` (~6.33:1 on neutral-50): Text elements - links, labels, emphasis

**Impact:** Creates visual hierarchy while maintaining accessibility across all use cases. Users never have to wonder "can I use this color here?"

### 2. Accessibility-First Refinement Process

**Initial Implementation:**
All primary colors were selected and mapped to semantic tokens based on brand strategy and aesthetic goals.

**Testing Phase:**
Contrast ratios were calculated for all critical light/dark mode combinations using WCAG Contrast Checker before implementation (not retrofitted).

**Issue Discovered:**
Two colors fell slightly short of WCAG AA standards:
- `neutral-600` (#75746F): 4.39:1 on neutral-50 (needs 4.5:1)
- `sage-600` (#677A5F): 4.35:1 on neutral-50 (needs 4.5:1)

**Decision Point - Three Options:**
- **A.** Adjust colors to meet AA standards perfectly
- **B.** Accept as-is with usage restrictions (large text/18px+ only)
- **C.** Use only on elevated white surfaces where they pass AA

**Final Decision: Option A**

**Why:**
- Simpler system with zero exceptions or caveats
- Developers can use these colors anywhere confidently
- Professional standard: "Every color passes AA, no asterisks"
- Adjustments were minimal (1-2 luminance points) and imperceptible to the eye

**Adjustments Made:**
- `neutral-600`: #75746F → #71706A (now achieves 4.66:1)
- `sage-600`: #677A5F → #5E7157 (now achieves 4.95:1)

**Verification:**
All combinations re-tested and confirmed to meet or exceed WCAG AA standards.

**Design Principle Demonstrated:**
"Accessibility is non-negotiable" - when faced with colors that were 97% of the way there, we chose to close the gap rather than document exceptions.

### 3. Dark Mode Strategy

**Decision:** Use lighter tints (200-300 range) rather than simple inversion.

**Rationale:**
- Maintains warmth in dark mode (many dark themes become cold/desaturated)
- Reduces eye strain with softer contrasts
- All dark mode combinations exceed AA, most achieve AAA
- Creates cohesive experience across themes

**Example:**
- Light mode primary: `terracotta-600` (darker, saturated)
- Dark mode primary: `terracotta-200` (lighter, softer)
- Result: Both feel like terracotta, but optimized for their context

### 4. Semantic Token Architecture

**Decision:** Create semantic tokens (e.g., `primary`, `accent`) rather than using primitive colors directly in components.

**Rationale:**
- Theme switching becomes trivial (just swap token mappings)
- Components never hardcode colors
- Future color adjustments require updating only token mappings
- Aligns with design system best practices (Style Dictionary, Tokens Studio)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// ✅ Components use semantic tokens
backgroundColor: colors.primary

// ❌ Components never use primitives directly
backgroundColor: colors.terracotta[600]
```

### Lessons Learned

1. **Test early, test often:** Calculating contrast ratios before full implementation saved refactoring time
2. **Small adjustments, big impact:** 0.11 ratio units made the difference between "mostly accessible" and "fully compliant"
3. **Documentation matters:** Writing usage rules forces you to think through edge cases before they become bugs
4. **Warmth is achievable:** Accessible doesn't mean cold - warm neutrals prove you can have both

### Verification Results

All final contrast ratios verified with WCAG Contrast Checker:

**✅ Light Mode - All Pass AA/AAA**
- terracotta-600 on neutral-50: 4.65:1 (AA)
- terracotta-700 on neutral-50: 6.33:1 (AA)
- neutral-900 on neutral-50: 12.91:1 (AAA)
- neutral-600 on neutral-50: 4.66:1 (AA) ✨ Adjusted
- sage-600 on neutral-50: 4.95:1 (AA) ✨ Adjusted

**✅ Dark Mode - All Exceed AA (Most Achieve AAA)**
- terracotta-200 on neutral-950: 10.58:1 (AAA)
- neutral-50 on neutral-950: 15.45:1 (AAA)
- neutral-400 on neutral-950: 8.20:1 (AAA)
- sage-300 on neutral-950: 9.00:1 (AAA)

## Accessibility

All color combinations meet **WCAG 2.1 AA standards** (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text 18px+).

### Accessibility Notes

- All primary interactive elements exceed AA standards
- Body text combinations achieve AAA (7:1+) in both modes
- `terracotta-500` is restricted to large text (24px+) or decorative use only
- Color is never the sole means of conveying information
- Focus indicators use primary colors with sufficient contrast
